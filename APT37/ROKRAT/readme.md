  # ROKRAT (Windows) PS Decoder
This is a simple script to quickly decode the Powershell encoded command contained within payload delivery files. Most recently these are seen in the form of LNK documents. When receiving a sample, I am often aware of the time sensitivity of payload delivery host shutting down, and because I want to encoded shellcode payload quickly, I created this script. 

It will assist with the following steps when analysing ROKRAT samples:

 - User extracts encoded command (i.e running strings against LNK document)

 - User extract encoded portion of the command
 - User runs this script and inputs the encoded command
 - Script will decode the command showing the reflective powershell injection
 - Script will extract payload delivery host
 - Script will give the user the option to request the payload delivery host and pull the payload, it will zip the payload the the cwd with the password infected (ensure you are doing this is a lab environment. I don't accept responsibility for you pulling malware yourself etc.)
